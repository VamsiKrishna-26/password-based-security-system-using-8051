Password based security system using 8051 interfaced with LCD

In today's world, securing our belongings and information is paramount. Traditional 
mechanical locks, while familiar, offer limited protection. This project tackles this challenge by 
designing a more secure access control system: a digital code lock programmed in assembly 
language for a microcontroller. 
 
 
The motivation to embark on this project stems from the recognition of the pervasive 
importance of security in modern society. With the proliferation of digital technologies and 
interconnected systems, the threat landscape has evolved, necessitating advanced measures to 
protect assets and ensure privacy. Traditional lock and key mechanisms, while effective to 
some extent, often fall short in addressing the dynamic security requirements of today's world. 
Consequently, there arises a need for smarter, more adaptable solutions capable of Keeping out 
determined intruders while offering convenience and ease of use to authorized users. 
 
 
The primary access relies on a pre-programmed code, typically 5 digits long. However, to 
prevent brute-force attacks, a lockout mechanism triggers after a set number of incorrect 
attempts.  To regain access after a lockout, a secondary 6-digit security key is required. This 
two-tiered approach significantly enhances security and user convenience. Even if the primary 
code is compromised, the additional security key prevents unauthorized entry. Additionally, 
the ability to reset the primary code allows users to regain access if forgotten. 
 
 
The overarching aim of our project is to design, implement, and evaluate a digital code lock 
system that offers robust security features while prioritizing user-friendliness and efficiency. 
Our primary goal is to develop a reliable and effective access control solution that addresses 
the evolving security challenges of modern society. By leveraging assembly language 
programming on a microcontroller platform, we aim to create a versatile system capable of 
safeguarding assets, protecting privacy, and enhancing overall security.
